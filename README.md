# react-essentials_app


<p>
  In this React app, I practiced using the core concepts of React, such as components, JSX, props and state. I decided to briefly explain and show a short example for each of these 4 core concepts of React. The main JSX file is the App.jsx, which is rendered in the index.html. I have created 3 child components of the App component: Header, CoreConcepts and TabButton, each of which has it's own folder and CSS file.
